## Combined system
The purpose of this project is to combine 1DoF and 6DoF platforms. The aim is to find a way to further emulate a patient's behaviour that is present during treatment such as breathing, which can make it much harder to track and target the tumor. The 6DoF platform is used to mimic the internal motion of the tumor while the 1D plaform is intended to use the data collected from surface/external tracers on the patient to model and replicate the external motion of the tumor. 

This folder contains combined system documentation and results from previous experiments. 
The traces that have been used for the tests can be found here :
