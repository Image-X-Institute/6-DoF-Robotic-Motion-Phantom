# 6 DoF Robotic Motion Phantom

The 6 DoF Robotic Motion Phantom application has been developed to perform quality assurance tests for real-time image-guided radiotherapy systems. The 6 DoF system consists of a six-axis robotic arm (Universal Robot, UR3), an acrylic phantom, a custom-base plate to mount the robotic phantom onto the treatment couch and a software application which controls the robotic phantom to reproduce the patient-measured tumor motion. The [software](https://github.com/ACRF-Image-X-Institute/6-DoF-Robotic-Motion-Phantom/blob/main/PhantomControl.sln) provides methods to implement the appropriate sequence of transformations to accurately reproduce the full range (6 DoF translational and rotational motion) and rate of patient-measured tumour motion using the robotically controlled phantom. The set-up and motion trace repeatability of the robotic system was evaluated against the Calypso system and was shown to provide sub-mm and sub-degree accuracy and precision in translational and rotational degrees of freedom respectively. For more details, please see [this publication](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab1935).

## Key Features

- Accurate motion reproducibility for 6DoF tumour motion.
- A user-friendly GUI interface.
- Design compactness.
- Easy workflow.


## Getting Started
### Requirements
    
  * Hardware
     - A six-axis robot (Tested on a commercially available [UR3 Universal Robot](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur3-robot/)) and its associated hardware
     - A phantom
  
  * Software 
     - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with .NET framework 4.5 (tested). May work on other versions too.  
     - Winforms
  
  * Third-party libraries (located in `External Libraries/`)
     - EasyModbusTCP v4.2
     - LiveCharts v0.9.7
     - LiveCharts.WinForms v0.9.7.1
     - LiveCharts.Wpf v0.9.7
     - Math.Net Numerics v4.12.0
     
## Documentation

The [Documentation folder](https://github.com/ACRF-Image-X-Institute/6-DoF-Robotic-Motion-Phantom/tree/main/Documentation) contains required information to assemble a similar 6-DoF system: Bill of materials, CAD files for the phantom and hardware tools, robot specifications, documentation, a user-guide to operate the system, and, step-by-step QA procedure for a real-time image-guided radiotherapy technology, Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM) using the robotic phantom. 

### Setting up the Robotic Motion Phantom

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/ACRF-Image-X-Institute/6-DoF-Robotic-Motion-Phantom/blob/main/Documentation/Getting%20Started.docx).

### Building the Robotic Motion Phantom software

The software was written and tested in C# using Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Framework 4.5 using Windows 10 64-bit, but may work with other versions of Visual Studio.

1. Open `PhantomControl.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution in Debug mode.
3. This will create the application `PhantomControl\bin\Debug\PhantomControl.exe` which can then be operated using [this guide](https://github.com/ACRF-Image-X-Institute/6-DoF-Robotic-Motion-Phantom/blob/main/Documentation/Software%20GUI%20Guide.pdf) when connected to a six-axis robotic system.

## Limitations and safety 

The UR3 robot has automated tasks up to 3 kg (6.6 lbs). It has reach radius of up to 500 mm (19.7 in) with 0.1 mm and 0.2 deg repeatability. For all other safety related issues, please visit the [Universal Robot website](https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/).

## Future work

Future works planned to be done with this project:

- Phantoms with lung insert for quality assurance of the markerless tracking systems.
- Concurrent geometric and dosimetric quality assurance with a radiation detector or films. 
- QA other real-time tracking systems such as depth sensors as used in the [Remove the Mask Project](https://image-x.sydney.edu.au/home/remove-the-mask/).
